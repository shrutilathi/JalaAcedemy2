 *1.Create a class with PRIVATE fields, private method and a main method.
 * Print the fields in main method. Call the private method in main method.
Create a sub class and try to access the private fields and methods from sub class.

 * @author shruti
 * In this example, we have created two classes A and AM1.
 * A class contains private data member and private method. 
 * We are accessing these private members from outside the class, 
 * so there is a compile-time error.
